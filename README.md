### Task allocation and Tracking

For Tchiba, I am using a mixture of strategies and technologies to create, allocate and track tasks. 
Firstly I simply drafted a couple of ideas on paper for the application, before settling on a broad concept I was happy with. I then went a little deeper and touched on some basic user story ideas for how I wanted the application to function.

From here, I moved onto Trello to start synthesizing the technical requirements with a more fleshed out vision of how the app was to be built. This allowed me to map out both the rubric requirements (to easily refer back to), and the technical/document requirements for the application. 

I used this map to then flesh out the idea for Tchiba further. By referring back to the requirements, I was able to build a list of tasks for documentation. At this stage the initial user stories were planned also, to try and bring a bit more dimension to the planning process.

From here I was able to create my implementation plan by mixing the user stories (What I want) with the technical requirements (What is required). This gave me a solid structure of code related tasks for when the documentation had been finished. 

From this point Trello became a way of keeping track what had been done in regards to all of these lists. It also served as a way to keep track on what had been done already, what I was currently working on and what I thought needed to be done next. 

I also used a devlog to keep a log of what had been done on what day as the project progressed.
